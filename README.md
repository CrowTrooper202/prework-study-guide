## Usage

the main usage of this product is to use as a resource to referback to information I found important. i deally this would also be able to help some one else just starting out in coding. it will have usful information on topis likes; HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and GitHub.  For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
